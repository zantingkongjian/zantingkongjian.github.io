 原文链接：[What I Wish Someone Had Told Me](https://blog.samaltman.com/what-i-wish-someone-had-told-me) 


1.Optimism, obsession, self-belief, raw horsepower and personal connections are how things get started.

要做一件事儿，是从乐观、痴迷、自信、原始动力和人际关系开始的。

2.Cohesive teams, the right combination of calmness and urgency, and unreasonable commitment are how things get finished. Long-term orientation is in short supply; try not to worry about what people think in the short term, which will get easier over time.

有凝聚力的团队、冷静与紧迫感的恰当结合，以及对目标的超预期承诺，是完成任务的关键。长期规划往往被忽视；不必担心他人在短期内的看法，随着时间的推移，会逐渐好起来。

3.It is easier for a team to do a hard thing that really matters than to do an easy thing that doesn’t really matter; audacious ideas motivate people.

对于团队来说，完成一件真正重要的难事比做一件无关紧要的易事更容易；大胆的想法能够激发斗志。

4.Incentives are superpowers; set them carefully.

激励机制是超能力；要谨慎设定。

5.Concentrate your resources on a small number of high-conviction bets; this is easy to say but evidently hard to do. You can delete more stuff than you think.

将资源集中在少数你深信不疑的事上；这话说起来容易，但做起来难。你能排除掉的东西比你想象的要多。

6.Communicate clearly and concisely.

言简意赅地交流沟通。

7.Fight bullshit and bureaucracy every time you see it and get other people to fight it too. Do not let the org chart get in the way of people working productively together.

每当遇到废话和官僚主义，都要坚决反对，并鼓励他人也这样做。不要让组织架构妨碍人们高效协同工作。

8.Outcomes are what count; don’t let good process excuse bad results.

结果才是最重要的；不要让好的过程成为坏结果的借口。

9.Spend more time recruiting. Take risks on high-potential people with a fast rate of improvement. Look for evidence of getting stuff done in addition to intelligence.

花更多时间招聘。敢于选择那些进步飞速的高潜力人才。除智力外，还要寻找他们完成任务的证据。

10.Superstars are even more valuable than they seem, but you have to evaluate people on their net impact on the performance of the organization.

超级明星比你想象的更有价值，但必须根据他们对组织的真正影响来评估他们。

11.Fast iteration can make up for a lot; it’s usually ok to be wrong if you iterate quickly. Plans should be measured in decades, execution should be measured in weeks.

快速迭代可以解决很多问题；一般情况下，如果你能迅速做出调整，犯错是可以接受的。计划应该以十年为单位来制定，执行则应该以周来衡量。

12.Don’t fight the business equivalent of the laws of physics.

不要挑战商业世界的基本法则。

13.Inspiration is perishable and life goes by fast. Inaction is a particularly insidious type of risk.

灵感易逝，生命短暂。不行动是一种特别隐蔽的风险。

14.Scale often has surprising emergent properties.

规模经常会带来出人意料的新特性。

15.Compounding exponentials are magic. In particular, you really want to build a business that gets a compounding advantage with scale.

复利指数很神奇。特别是，你真的想建立一个通过规模获得复利优势的企业。

16.Get back up and keep going.

跌倒了就爬起来，继续前进。

17.Working with great people is one of the best parts of life.

与优秀的人共事是人生最美好的体验之一。
